sForum - Very (very) Simple Message Board
Version: 0.1

Author:

Description:
	This is a very (very) simple PHP forum.
	It is written in PHP, using a MySQL
	database for storage. It is a project that
	I do in my free time (and I do not have 
	a lot) but my intention is to turn this
	very (very) simple PHP forum into a just 
	very simple PHP forum. I believe that 
	the result of this work may can help some
	webmasters who need a Board Messaging system
	but not necessary so powerful as phpBB or
	many others. In any way, is a project I do
	to learn and improve, but if it can help to any
	other users, much better.
	
Installation:
	1) Upload the files in your server
	2) In file data/schema.mysql.sql you have the schema
		of the DataBase. Create a new database and copy & paste
		the content of the file.
	3) In the file config/connection.php you will
		need to write the correct credentials for 
		to connect with your database: host, username,
		password and dbname.
